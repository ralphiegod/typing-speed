# Typing speed test

A quick test that will check how many words per minute can you type.
Simply rewrite the non-sense auto-generated sentence and confirm it with Enter.

Get the .py if you want to mess with code. If not interested, .zip version with executable is for you.

This is my first publically published project made with :heart: in Python3.
Every star will be appreciated and taken as motivation :+1:
